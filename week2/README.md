1.1 How many 100bp reads are needed to sequence a 1Mbp genome to 3x coverage?

30000

1.3

There are 50670 bases with a coverage of 0
This is 5.067% of the genome. The fit to the
theoretical poisson pmf is very strong.
Visually, it is clear to see that the Normal
pdf is a decent fit, but not as good at the
poisson pmf.

1.4

There are 55 bases with a coverage of 0 (0.0055%).
The fit to both the Normal and the Poisson are quite
good, and it becomes difficult to tell that the poisson
fit is that much better than the Normal fit.

1.5

There are 10 bases with a coverage of 0, 0.001% of the genome.
The fits to the poisson and normal distributions are nearly
identical, and both are a very tight fit.

In order to accurately construct the genome sequence, we would need a reference
genome. Then we could perform alignments to the reference and resolve abiguous
k-mers. The other option is to have reads long enough such that there are no
ambiguities in the k-mer sequence. With a read length long enough to capture
the entire sequence, there is no need for a reference sequence.

Studying genomics is an exciting and important field with numerous reasons to
pique your interest. Genomics refers to the study of an organism's complete set
of genes, including all of its DNA, and how these genes interact with each
other and the environment. Here are several compelling reasons to consider
genomics as a field of study, supported by references:

1. **Personalized Medicine**: Genomic research has paved the way for
   personalized medicine, where treatments and medications can be tailored to
   an individual's genetic makeup. This can lead to more effective and safer
   treatments. A study published in *Nature Reviews Genetics* discusses the
   impact of genomics on personalized medicine (Ginsburg, G. S., & McCarthy, J.
   J. (2001). Personalized medicine: Revolutionizing drug discovery and patient
   care. *Nature Reviews Genetics, 2*(5), 314-319).

2. **Disease Understanding and Prevention**: Genomics has greatly enhanced our
   understanding of the genetic basis of diseases. By studying genomics, you
   can contribute to uncovering the genetic underpinnings of various diseases,
   leading to better prevention and treatment strategies. The National Human
   Genome Research Institute provides insights into genomics and its impact on
   disease research (https://www.genome.gov/genomics-and-medicine).

3. **Genetic Counseling**: Genomic knowledge is vital in genetic counseling,
   where professionals help individuals and families understand their genetic
   risks and make informed decisions about their health. The American Board of
   Genetic Counseling provides resources on the importance of genomics in
   genetic counseling
   (https://www.abgc.net/why-is-genetic-counseling-important/).

4. **Biotechnology and Industry**: Genomics plays a significant role in the
   biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. Companies use genomic data to
   develop new drugs, therapies, and diagnostics. Deloitte's report, "Genomics
   in Biotech and Pharma: Charting the Course Ahead," explores the impact of
   genomics on these industries
   (https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/life-sciences-health-care/us-lshc-2017-genomics-in-biotech-and-pharma.pdf).

5. **Agricultural Advancements**: Genomics is crucial in agricultural research,
   helping to create genetically modified crops that are more resistant to
   pests, drought, and other environmental stressors. A review published in
   *Trends in Plant Science* discusses the role of genomics in crop improvement
   (Varshney, R. K., & Dubey, A. (2009). Novel genomic tools and modern genetic
   and breeding approaches for crop improvement. *Trends in Plant Science,
   14*(12), 645-655).

6. **Evolutionary Insights**: Genomics allows us to trace the evolutionary
   history of species, helping us understand how life on Earth has evolved.
   A seminal paper by the Human Genome Project Consortium published in *Nature*
   provides insights into the sequencing and analysis of the human genome
   (Lander, E. S., et al. (2001). Initial sequencing and analysis of the human
   genome. *Nature, 409*(6822), 860-921).

7. **Ethical and Social Implications**: The study of genomics also encompasses
   ethical and social implications, including privacy concerns, genetic
   discrimination, and societal attitudes toward genetic information. The
   National Human Genome Research Institute discusses these issues on its
   website (https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/policy-issues).

8. **Cutting-Edge Technology**: Genomics is at the forefront of technological
   advancements, including next-generation sequencing and gene-editing tools
   like CRISPR-Cas9. Learning and working in genomics can provide opportunities
   to engage with cutting-edge technologies that have broad applications.

In conclusion, genomics is a multidisciplinary field with far-reaching
implications for medicine, agriculture, industry, and our understanding of life
itself. It offers opportunities for groundbreaking research and the potential
to make a significant impact on various aspects of society. The provided
references offer further insights into the importance of genomics in these
domains.

The chat gpt explanation makes sense.

The link: https://www.genome.gov/genomics-and-medicine does not resolve to a web page.

Nor does this: https://www.abgc.net/why-is-genetic-counseling-important/

This neither: https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/life-sciences-health-care/us-lshc-2017-genomics-in-biotech-and-pharma.pdf

The papers cited all exist, however.

The essay is mostly cogent, some weird things it says are that Biotech and
Industry are good reasons to study genomics. It may be trying to say that
Genomics is a "hot" field where you can find a nice-paying biotech job in.

It also mentions some Ethical and Social Implications. I could see this if one
were to study the genomics of human populations, but GPT lists some stuff about
privacy concerns, genetic discrimination, and genetic information. These are
more of policy-related points of interest, and don't have much to do with the
academic discipline of genomics. But it's not a huge stretch. There are a lot
of questions that come up regarding findings and more specifically the data
that drives genomics.
