Q1: Yes, the majority of CpG dinucleutides are methylated

sites found only in ONT: 53346
sites found only in bisulfite: 132466
percentage of sites found in both: 95.9

Q2: There is more coverage in bisulfite sequencing. It seems like bisulfite sequencing is better because you get more reads at higher coverage

Q3: There is notmuch difference between the violin plots (evidenced by low correlation coefficient). There are fewer reads with 0 methylation change in nanopore.

Q4: Based on the violin plot, the data show slight evidence that there is more global methylation in tumor samples.

Q5: There is an apparent loss of methylation in DNMT3A. This likely leads to more transcription and an overactive DNMT3A gene product.

Q6: Genetic imprinting is when one parental copy of a gene is silenced and the other is expressed

Q7: Not enough features to create 2 classes. Max # of classes = 0. There need to be variants in the selected range in order for reads to be phased.

Q8: I already answered this question. I must not understand what is being asked. I also have no idea why I'm being asked this question, but my answer is that a set of reads containing variants can be phased.
